# SCRIPT: cli.sh
# DESCRIPTION: The ./dev entry point — one verb set, identical in every repo.
# USAGE: ./dev <verb> [target] [options]
#
# PARAMETERS:
#   Run ./dev with no arguments for the verb list.
# EXIT_CODES:
#   0  The verb succeeded, or is not applicable in this repo.
#   1  The verb failed.
#   2  Unknown verb.
# ----------------------------------------------------
#
# Copied from script-helpers templates/dev-cli/. Repo-specific behaviour belongs
# in scripts/project.sh, which is sourced below when it exists — not in here, so
# that this file can be refreshed from the template without losing local work.
#
# To override a verb, define project_<verb> in scripts/project.sh:
#
#     project_run() { flutter run -d "${DEV_DEVICE:-linux}"; }
#
# Anything not overridden falls back to the shared implementation, which drives
# script-helpers' android/flutter/gradle/screencap modules.

Usage: ./dev <verb> [target] [options]

Core
  install       Install dependencies and initialize submodules. Idempotent.
  build         Produce artifacts. Never starts anything.
  run           Start the app in the foreground.
  stop          Stop what run started. Keeps containers and data.
  test          Run the test suite.
  preflight     Run every check CI would have run. The pre-push hook calls this.
  scan          Secret and dependency scan only (gitleaks, audits).  [--docker]
  e2e           Browser tests with Playwright, where playwright.config.* exists.
  deploy        Build, then install and launch on a connected device,
                or deploy to Cloudflare with `deploy cloudflare --env <name>`.
  clean         Remove build output and caches. Never touches user data.
  update        Sync submodules and refresh pinned dependencies.

Mobile
  devices       List connected devices, emulators, AVDs and simulators.
  screenshot    Capture a PNG from a device.        [--out <path>]
  record        Capture screen video.               [--seconds <n>] [--gif]
  logs          Stream filtered device logs.
  release       Bump the version across manifests and open a CHANGELOG section.

Targets   android ios host backend frontend linux web macos windows cloudflare
Options   --device <id>  --user <id>  --release  --verbose

deploy cloudflare passes its options straight to cloudflare_deploy:
  --env <name>          required; also the wrangler --env
  --config <path>       wrangler config to deploy
  --dist <dir>          build output holding a generated deploy config
  --status-path <path>  JSON endpoint carrying the deployed version
  --yes                 skip the typed confirmation for a protected environment
  --dry-run             build and validate, deploy nothing
A protected environment (default: production) asks you to type its name. With
no terminal it refuses rather than waiting, so pass --yes in automation.

--user is the Android profile to install into, default 0 (the device owner).
deploy verifies the package is visible there afterwards: an unqualified install
can succeed into a work profile or Secure Folder the shell cannot read back,
leaving the app absent from the launcher while adb reports Success.
List profiles with: adb shell pm list users

Captured media defaults to docs/screenshots/. Override with $SCREENCAP_DIR.
